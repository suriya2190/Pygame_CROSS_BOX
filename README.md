# Tic-Tac-Toe
   The project is entitled as Tic-tac-toe. which was known as (XO).Whether In normal it is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.We got a simple grid setup that shows me the coordinates and changes the boxes with X &amp; O when it's clicked.It takes up to 9 turns to complete one game.
